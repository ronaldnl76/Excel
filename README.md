# Excel
**Note about these scripts:**
Bunch of nice uncategorized Excel workbooks and snipets

Through the years I've created lots of Excel workbooks
with VBA code for different purposes. This is my first attempt to share
those Excel workbooks with people all arround the world.

## Sheets inside this Repository:
- **MS-PATCH TUESDAY.xlsx** - This Excel spreadsheet is designed to indicate when Microsoft Patch Tuesday occurs, which is traditionally on the second Tuesday of each month. In addition, it also highlights the following Wednesday and Saturday after Patch Tuesday. These days are often when organizations typically deploy the Microsoft patches. While this might seem straightforward, there's a slight complexity involved. The Wednesday following the second Tuesday of the month can sometimes be tricky, as it doesn't always fall on the same week. For example, there are instances when the Wednesday after the second Tuesday is actually the third Wednesday of the month. A case in point is January 2025â€”January 15th is the third Wednesday, even though it comes right after the second Tuesday, January 14th. The function embedded in this spreadsheet automatically calculates these dates for you, ensuring that you have accurate information about when to schedule your patch deployments. This tool helps streamline the process, making it easier to plan and execute updates without confusion.

## Liability

**All Excel Workbooks and code are provided as-is and you use them at your own risk.**
